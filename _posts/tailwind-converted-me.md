## How it happened

I used to be a die-hard fan of Sass, but over time, I've found myself growing increasingly frustrated with the amount of time and effort it took to maintain the CSS organized, legible and scalable. 

Don't get me wrong, Sass is a fantastic tool with a lot of powerful features, but as projects grow in complexity, even close to perfect SASS code can be a mess to look at and use. I found that it just wasn't fun to write CSS anymore.

## My friend is a Tailwind preacher

He swears for his life that Tailwind is the best thing there is when it comes to CSS. At first, I was skeptical. I had always thought of utility classes as something of a mess and wasn't sure that I could get on board with the idea of using a framework built entirely around them. But I tried it. So, to give credit where is due, i appreciate my friend [@vincorreia](https://github.com/vincorreia) for introducing me to this magic.

Let me just go ahead and tell you, I missed being this excited about CSS, it changed everything for me. I began to realize just how powerful and expressive this approach could be.

## How it compares to SASS

One of the things I love most about Tailwind is the flexibility it gives me. With Sass, I often felt like I was fighting against the language, trying to use CSS Guidelines or having my co-workers use them, always trying to create a standard that, honestly, just wasn't enough. It felt counter-productive. 

With Tailwind, everything just clicks. The class names make intuitive sense, and it's easy to build up complex layouts and designs by stringing together these simple utility classes, besides, since they are a set of "rules" to follow, Tailwind is also a design pattern, a standard. Something that is really hard to replicate with vanilla CSS or SASS. Plus, the built-in responsive design features are a godsend, making it incredibly easy to create responsive designs that look great on any screen size.

## They know what they're doing

If you don't already know, the Tailwind team has released a [book](https://www.refactoringui.com/) about their thought process around the framework and it's perks. And although I haven't had the chance to yet read it, they offer 2 free chapters as samples to those who want to get a taste.

One of those chapters is about their color pallette, how they chose all the utility color classes and it's relative accents. By looking through the pallette on their documentation page, you may think that they simply generated these generic colors by looping through some hex code and creating other versions of it. But the truth is, all the colors were ***handpicked***. *What?!?!* I know, right???

Okay, maybe you didn't get as excited as I did, but, believe it or not, they made ***ALL*** the colors match with ***ANY*** color you pick from the pallette. 

That alone for me is mindblowing, it really shows you how much thought they put behind their work and I know it's paying off. If you have used any Tailwind at all, you maybe have realized that it's hard to make something ugly. The framwork keeps fixing things.

## Conclusion

Perhaps the thing I appreciate most about Tailwind is the peace of mind it gives me. All of that stress just melts away. Writing CSS, for me, became what is was supposed to always be, fun.

All in all, I have been very impressed with Tailwind, and it has truly changed my heart when it comes to working with CSS, making the process more enjoyable and efficient. I found myself reaching for this framework more and more, leaving my old ways behind. Now I can confidently say that I have become a huge fan of Tailwind and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use CSS framework.
