## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a JavaScript framework for building web applications. It is a component-based framework, which means that developers build their applications by creating and composing small, reusable components. Svelte uses a unique approach to building web applications, it compiles the components to vanilla JavaScript at build-time, which results in a highly optimized and small bundle size. Unlike other frameworks, Svelte doesn't use a virtual DOM (Document Object Model), instead, it updates the DOM directly and only the necessary parts of the application, which improves the performance of the web application.

Svelte is not a Single-Page Application (SPA) framework by default, but it can be used to build SPAs.
A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server.

Svelte is a component-based framework, it allows developers to break down their application into small, reusable components, which can be rendered and updated dynamically on the same page, which is a characteristic of a SPA, but Svelte does not provide a built-in routing system, or other features that are typically associated with SPA frameworks, such as client-side routing, client-side state management, or a client-side development server. That's where SvelteKit comes in.

## Svelte + SvelteKit

Sveltekit is a new framework built on top of Svelte. It provides a higher level of abstraction and a set of powerful tools for building web applications.

Sveltekit provides a consistent, easy-to-use API for building and managing application state, which makes it simpler to develop complex applications with svelte. It also includes features like server-side rendering, a built-in development server, and a powerful set of APIs for managing application state and handling events.

Additionally, Sveltekit has a built-in routing system, which makes it easy to handle different routes and URLs in your application. It also includes a file-based configuration system, which allows you to customize the behavior of your application based on different environment variables and settings.

Sveltekit's goal is to provide a more complete framework for building web applications with Svelte, making it easier for developers to adapt their app, choosing between SSR and CSR, while still allowing them to use the tools and frameworks they are already familiar with.

## Why i love it so much

Most of all, I love its simplicity. Unlike some other frameworks, it doesn't rely on a complex set of abstractions or require a steep learning curve. Instead, it provides a set of intuitive, easy-to-use tools that make it easy to build complex web applications, you don't need Redux, you don't need ContextAPI, forms are a breeze to work with and so much more...

Sveltekit has a strong and active community. The framework is open-source, and developers from all over the world contribute to its development and improvement. This ensures that the framework is always evolving and improving, and that developers can easily get help and support when they need it.

All of these factors combined make Sveltekit a powerful and versatile framework that can be used to build a wide range of web applications. I believe that Sveltekit has the potential to become the new React in terms of job openings. As more and more companies and developers start to adopt this framework, the demand for Sveltekit developers will likely increase, leading to more job opportunities in this field.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I am a big fan of Sveltekit and I believe it has the potential to become one of the most popular frameworks in the web development industry. It is simple, powerful, and fast, and it has a strong and active community. I hope to see more and more Svelte, and not just for developers side-projects.
